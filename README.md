OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT : DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN WITH VERILOG

OBJECTIVE

 To simulate verilog code to create various digital logic design using verilog and verify it with the help of testbench anf Functionally verify it with the help of Waveforms.

TOOLS USED 

 MODELSIM : Software used to simulate Verilog Code and generate WaveForms
 GOOGLE : To gather resources and data for simulation

 WAVEFORMS OBTAINED BY MODELSIM DURING SIMULATION
